What is Angular?ü§î
Angular is a framework, designed by the Google Team, and it has been widely used to design sites. Essentially, it is a framework to create frontends, based on TypeScript. In layman's terms: the page you see and interact on your web browser.

What is TensoFlow.js?ü§î
TensorFlow.js is a JavaScript-based library for deep learning, based on the classical TensorFlow, written in Python; you can also do simple learning machine, some simple mathematical operations with tensors and so on. There are several reasons for using TensorFlow.js instead of Python, and I hope to come back to that in the future.

A nice point is that they claim it is possible to transform models in both directions: TensorFlow.js <-> TensorFlow.

It is possible to transform models in both directions.

Further, they claim the two libraries are similar, making it easier for programmers from both communities to work together, with no segregation, ‚Äúus against them,‚Äù ‚Äúwhat is better and worse,‚Äù etc. Let¬¥s work and change the world instead of fighting!
